The Cursor Health Display mod draws your health in a ring around your mouse.
It does more than just that though, it also shows Mana, Wing Time, and Heal Potion Sickness, among other things.
I will probably add more, feel free to suggest things to add.

This mod does not change the mouse cursor itself. The cursor in the icon is the KDE Breeze cursor.

Also Credits to Lan's Simple Healthbar, which I used as a template.


Update V2.0:

    Replaced Enabled with Slider for Off, Legacy, and Images


    Images Mode:

        The Cursor display ring now uses sets of images, one set for each ring, and draws it in a UI.
        This produces a much cleaner and preformant result than drawing lines.
        It can now also show Mana Sickness


    For Config:

        Added drop downs for Common, Images, and Legacy settings.

        Dropped default for Legacy: Line Multiplyer to 0.05 instead of 0.5
        Flipped default for Common: Force Visiblity at full health to False
        Flipped default for Common: show heal sickness at full heath to True
        Added config for Mana Sickenss, which defailts to True
        Added config for Force Mana Sickness, which defaults to False
